    <h1>Scope of var, let  and const : </h1>
    <ul>
       <li>Var: Variables declared with var have function scope or global scope, meaning they are accessible throughout the function or globally. If declared outside any function, they become global variables. They can be re-declared and updated within their scope.</li>

       <li>var: Variables declared with var have function scope or global scope, meaning they are accessible throughout the function or globally. If declared outside any function, they become global variables. They can be re-declared and updated within their scope.</li>

       <li>const: Variables declared with const also have block scope like let, but they cannot be reassigned once they are initialized. However, for objects and arrays declared with const, their properties or elements can be mutated, but the reference to the object or array itself cannot be changed.</li>

    <h1>Use cases of null and undefined:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>null: Represents an intentional absence of any object value. It is often used to signify that a variable or object property does not currently have a value assigned to it. For example, it can be used to clear out the value of a variable or property.</li>

        <li>
            undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value. It is also returned by functions that do not explicitly return a value. It typically indicates a variable or property that has not been initialized.

    <h1>REST API:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>REST (Representational State Transfer) API is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server communication protocol, typically HTTP. RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. Resources are represented as URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), and data is exchanged between clients and servers in a standardized format, often JSON or XML. REST APIs promote scalability, reliability, and simplicity, making them widely used for building web services and web applications.</li>
